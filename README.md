# Spring Bootstrap Showcase

The unofficial Spring MVC Showcase with Bootstrap.

A fork of [Spring MVC Showcase](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-mvc-showcase), replacing JQuery-UI with [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) versions, Tomcat with embedded Jetty, Tiles with [Sitemesh](http://www.sitemesh.org/), and other goodies.

For a complex use of Spring/JQuery/Bootstrap/Ajax, see my [Spring Best Practices App](https://github.com/priyatam/spring-best-practices).

For a minimalist workflow on Bootstrap and Less, checkout [Lesser](https://github.com/priyatam/lesser).

Major Versions used:

- Spring 4.1.0 / Bootstrap 3.2.0 (master)
- Spring 3.2.5 / Bootstrap 3 ([Branch 2.3](https://github.com/priyatam/springmvc-bootstrap-showcase/tree/3.x))
- Spring 3.1 / Bootstrap 2.3.x ([Branch 2.3](https://github.com/priyatam/springmvc-bootstrap-showcase/tree/2.x))

Live Demo on Heroku.

I now code primarily in Clojure and Nodejs and no longer active in Java. If you're interested in
maintaining this repo, including a complete refactor of frontend with Backbone and Bootstrap/Less,
please email me.
